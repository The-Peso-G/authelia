The following project allows you to use Authelia's one-time password (OTP) 2-factor authentication (2FA) through only
[basic auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication)
and a custom credentials format described below.
This allows you to use 2FA on clients and scenarios
that demand basic auth, e.g. [webdav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) network streaming.
